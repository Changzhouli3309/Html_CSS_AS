            <p>
              The Ragdoll is a cat breed with a color point coat and blue eyes.
              They are large and muscular semi-longhair cat with a soft and
              silky coat. Developed by American breeder Ann Baker in the 1960s,
              they are best known for their docile and placid temperament and
              affectionate nature. The name "Ragdoll" is derived from the
              tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go
              limp and relaxed when picked up. Particularly popular in both the
              United Kingdom and the breed's native United States, ragdoll cats
              often are known as "dog-like cats" or "puppy-like cats" due to
              behaviors such as their tendency to follow people around, their
              ease at being physically handled, and their relative lack of
              aggression toward other pets.

          <h2>History</h2>
          <div class="media-body">
            <p>
              In the 1960s, a regular, non-pedigreed, light-grey, domestic
              longhaired cat named Josephine produced several litters of typical
              cats. Josephine was of a Persian/Angora type and had litters sired
              by several unknown male Birman or Burmese-like cats, one of which
              had the Siamese point coloration. Josephine later produced kittens
              with a docile, placid temperament, affectionate nature, and a
              tendency to go limp and relaxed when picked up. When a subsequent
              litter produced more of the same, Ann Baker purchased several
              kittens from the owner who lived behind her and, believing that
              she had something special, set out to create what is now known as
              the ragdoll. The breed was selectively bred over many years for
              desirable traits, such as large size, gentle demeanor, pointed
              coloration, and a tendency to go limp when picked up. Out of those
              early litters came Blackie, an all black Burmese-like male, and
              Daddy Warbucks, a seal point with white feet. Daddy Warbucks sired
              the founding bi-color female Fugianna, and Blackie sired
              Buckwheat, a dark brown/black Burmese-like female. Both Fugianna
              and Buckwheat were daughters of Josephine. All Ragdolls are
              descended from Baker's cats through matings of Daddy Warbucks to
              Fugianna and Buckwheat. Baker, in an unusual move, spurned
              traditional cat-breeding associations. She trademarked the name
              Ragdoll, set up her own registry (the International Ragdoll Cat
              Association (IRCA)) ca. 1971, and enforced stringent standards on
              anyone who wanted to breed or sell cats under that name. The
              Ragdolls were also not allowed to be registered in other breed
              associations. The IRCA is still in existence today but is quite
              small, particularly since Baker's death in 1997. IRCA cats are not
              recognized in any major cat breed organization or cat show. In
              1975, a group led by a husband-and-wife team, Denny and Laura
              Dayton, broke ranks with the IRCA with the aim of gaining
              mainstream recognition for the Ragdoll. Beginning with a breeding
              pair of IRCA cats, this group eventually developed the Ragdoll
              standard currently accepted by major cat registries such as the
              CFA and the FIFe. Since the spread of the Ragdoll breed in America
              during the early 1960s, a breeding pair of Ragdolls was exported
              to the UK. This pair was followed by eight more cats to fully
              establish the breed in the UK, where it is recognised by the
              Governing Council of the Cat Fancy In 1994, a second group decided
              to leave the IRCA and form its own group owing to increasingly
              strict breeding restrictions. This group later established the
              Ragamuffin breed. Because Baker owned the rights to the name
              "Ragdoll", no offshoot groups were legally able to call their cats
              Ragdolls until 2005, when the trademark on "Ragdoll" was not
              renewed. The largest international Ragdoll breed club is the
              Ragdoll Fanciers' Club International (RFCI).
