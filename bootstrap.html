        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Ragdoll is a cat breed with a color point coat and blue eyes.
          They are large and muscular semi-longhair cat with a soft and
          silky coat. Developed by American breeder Ann Baker in the 1960s,
          they are best known for their docile and placid temperament and
          affectionate nature. The name "Ragdoll" is derived from the
          tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go
          limp and relaxed when picked up. Particularly popular in both the
          United Kingdom and the breed's native United States, ragdoll cats
          often are known as "dog-like cats" or "puppy-like cats" due to
          behaviors such as their tendency to follow people around, their
          ease at being physically handled, and their relative lack of
          aggression toward other pets.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h2>Temperament</h2>
        <p>The Ragdoll is marketed by breeders as having a docile, calm and floppy nature with claims that these
          characteristics have been passed down from the Persian and Birman breeds. Opinions vary as to
          whether this trait might be the result of genetic mutation. The extreme docility of some individuals
          has led to the myth that Ragdolls are pain resistant. Some breeders in Britain have tried to breed
          away from the limpness owing to concerns that extreme docility "might not be in the best interests
          of the cat".

          Breed standard marketing and publicity material describe the Ragdoll as affectionate, intelligent,
          relaxed in temperament, gentle, and an easy-to-handle lap cat. The animals are often known
          as "puppy cats", "dog-like cats", "cat-dogs", etc., because of their placid nature and affectionate
          behavior, with the cats often following owners from room to room as well as seeking physical
          affection akin to certain dog breeds. Ragdolls can be trained to retrieve toys and enjoy doing so.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          In the 1960s, a regular, non-pedigreed, light-grey, domestic
          longhaired cat named Josephine produced several litters of typical
          cats. Josephine was of a Persian/Angora type and had litters sired
          by several unknown male Birman or Burmese-like cats, one of which
          had the Siamese point coloration. Josephine later produced kittens
          with a docile, placid temperament, affectionate nature, and a
          tendency to go limp and relaxed when picked up. When a subsequent
          litter produced more of the same, Ann Baker purchased several
          kittens from the owner who lived behind her and, believing that
          she had something special, set out to create what is now known as
          the ragdoll. The breed was selectively bred over many years for
          desirable traits, such as large size, gentle demeanor, pointed
          coloration, and a tendency to go limp when picked up. Out of those
          early litters came Blackie, an all black Burmese-like male, and
          Daddy Warbucks, a seal point with white feet. Daddy Warbucks sired
          the founding bi-color female Fugianna, and Blackie sired
          Buckwheat, a dark brown/black Burmese-like female. Both Fugianna
          and Buckwheat were daughters of Josephine. All Ragdolls are
          descended from Baker's cats through matings of Daddy Warbucks to
          Fugianna and Buckwheat. Baker, in an unusual move, spurned
          traditional cat-breeding associations. She trademarked the name
          Ragdoll, set up her own registry (the International Ragdoll Cat
          Association (IRCA)) ca. 1971, and enforced stringent standards on
          anyone who wanted to breed or sell cats under that name. The
          Ragdolls were also not allowed to be registered in other breed
          associations. The IRCA is still in existence today but is quite
          small, particularly since Baker's death in 1997. IRCA cats are not
          recognized in any major cat breed organization or cat show. In
          1975, a group led by a husband-and-wife team, Denny and Laura
          Dayton, broke ranks with the IRCA with the aim of gaining
          mainstream recognition for the Ragdoll. Beginning with a breeding
          pair of IRCA cats, this group eventually developed the Ragdoll
          standard currently accepted by major cat registries such as the
          CFA and the FIFe. Since the spread of the Ragdoll breed in America
          during the early 1960s, a breeding pair of Ragdolls was exported
          to the UK. This pair was followed by eight more cats to fully
          establish the breed in the UK, where it is recognised by the
          Governing Council of the Cat Fancy In 1994, a second group decided
          to leave the IRCA and form its own group owing to increasingly
          strict breeding restrictions. This group later established the
          Ragamuffin breed. Because Baker owned the rights to the name
          "Ragdoll", no offshoot groups were legally able to call their cats
          Ragdolls until 2005, when the trademark on "Ragdoll" was not
          renewed. The largest international Ragdoll breed club is the
          Ragdoll Fanciers' Club International (RFCI).
